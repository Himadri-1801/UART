# UART
This project implements a basic UART protocol in Verilog for serial communication. It supports 8-bit data transmission with start and stop bits and allows configurable baud rates. The module includes both transmitter and receiver state machines, designed to handle bit timing and data integrity. Ideal for FPGA-based designs, it can be simulated using tools like Vivado or ModelSim.
